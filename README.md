# Country-Analysis

In this project, I am investigating the dataset containing information on region, population, area, birthrate, deathrate, net migration and more of 227 countries. I will be focusing on the factors that affecting a country's GDP per capita and try to make a model using the data of 227 countries from the dataset. I will also briefly discuss the total GDPs.
