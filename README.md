# Country-Analysis


  In this project, I am investigating the dataset containing information on region, population, area, birthrate, deathrate, net migration and more of 227 countries. I will be focusing on the factors that affecting a country's GDP per capita and try to make a model using the data of countries from the dataset. I will also briefly discuss the total GDPs. 
  
  I am investigating the dataset "Countries of the World"  from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world.
This dataset has each country as a data point, and for each, we have 20 columns, each column represents a different aspect or measure of the specific country.
