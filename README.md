# World Countries Analysis


  In this project, I am investigating the dataset containing information on region, population, area, birthrate, deathrate, net migration and more of 227 countries. I will be focusing on the factors that affecting a country's GDP per capita and try to make a model using the data of countries from the dataset. I will also briefly discuss the total GDPs. 
  
  I am investigating the dataset "Countries of the World"  from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world.
This dataset has each country as a data point, and for each, we have 20 columns, each column represents a different aspect or measure of the specific country. The goal of the project is to understand this dataset, get some insights from it. 

Also, the analysis includes the following research:
1. Countries With Low Birthrate & Low GDP
2. Regional analysis of GDP per capita, net migration, and population
3. Regional ranking analysis according to the average GDP per capita
4. Relationship between GDP per capita and various factors
5. Total GDP, and factors affecting on total GDP
6. Make a model that can predict GDP per capita for each country
